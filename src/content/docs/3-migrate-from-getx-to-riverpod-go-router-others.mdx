title: Migrate from Getx to Riverpod/GoRouter/Others in Flutter

    label: Flutter:From Getx to Riverpod/GoRouter/Others
---

## Background
[Getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) is a good Flutter framework to resolve the different kinds of pain points,
It's a beginner-friendly framework, so beginners are more like coding on "Getx" instead of "Flutter".

3 years ago, I jumped into Flutter for a toy-project as a backend developer and was surprised by the Getx, so simple and easy to understand/use.
I migrated that toy-project from the Flutter built-in state management/router to Getx.

Now, I'm creating a new toy-project and the initial version is almost done, still based on Getx.

Before moving it to Beta testing, I'm facing the challenges:

...

I should not complain about Getx as that's an opensource lib with MIT License and I contributed nothing.

[Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) is a new ~~**beginner-killer**~~ lib to manage the state and dependencies.
[go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router), an official lib for router navigation.

As a beginner, I'll use this article to note my migration progress.

Also, feel free to point out my misunderstanding or mistakes, or if you have any new cases to enhance the list.

Below cases are based on this baseline implicitly:
```
  riverpod: ^2.4.4
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.4
  riverpod_annotation: ^2.2.1
  riverpod_generator: 3.0.0-dev.3
  riverpod_lint: ^2.3.1
```

## Principle
1. Change the code page by page and the app should be runnable, always.
2. Not rewrite all of them or recreated a new one.


## Case by case

### Main entry
the `ProviderScope` (from Riverpod for initialization) and `GetMaterialApp` (from Getx for initialization) can work together.

so putting them together will make the app runnable during the migration.
```dart

    runApp(
      ProviderScope(
        child: GetMaterialApp(
          ...
        ),
      ),
    );
```

### Rx variables and Obx

Use `NotifierProvider` to replace the `Rx` variables,
use `ref.watch` to replace the `Obx` reactive widget.

**Before:**
```dart
class XXXXController extends GetxController{
  final RxBool _isPasswdHidden = true.obs;
  bool get isPasswdHidden => _isPasswdHidden.value;
  void toggle() => _isPasswdHidden.value = !_isPasswdHidden.value;
}

class XXXXWidgets extends StatelessWidget{
  XXXXController c = Get.find();

  get passwordTextField => Obx(() => TextFormField(
        obscureText: c.isPasswdHidden,
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          suffixIcon: IconButton(
            icon: Icon(
              c.isPasswdHidden
                  ? Icons.visibility
                  : Icons.visibility_off,
            ),
            onPressed: c.toggle,
          ),
          hintText: 'Password',
        ),
  ));
}
```

**After:**
```dart
@riverpod
class IsPasswordHidden extends _$IsPasswordHidden {
  @override
  bool build() => true; // same to the `true.obs` initialization

  void toggle()  {
    state = !state;
  }
}

// extending `ConsumerWidget` also works as long as the `ref` is able to refer
class XXXXWidgets extends StatelessWidget{
  get passwordTextField => Consumer(
      builder: (context, ref, child) => TextFormField(
        // use `ref.watch` to react the change
        obscureText: ref.watch(isPasswordHiddenProvider),
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          suffixIcon: IconButton(
            icon: Icon(
              !ref.watch(isPasswordHiddenProvider)
                  ? Icons.visibility
                  : Icons.visibility_off,
            ),
            // use `ref.read` in event function
            onPressed: ref.read(isPasswordHiddenProvider.notifier).toggle
          ),
          hintText: 'Password',
        ),
  ));
}
```
